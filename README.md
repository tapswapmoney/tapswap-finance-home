# Project Summary

This is a 1 hour test project, you will require to create a fully functional CRUD ( GET, PUT, POST, DELETE ). The majority of the React application will already be built for you. part of this project will be exploring the API and finding the appropriate endpoints to utilize to build the required functionality. utilize API endpoints that help you accomplish the goals of each feature and utilize the necessary `react hooks` that suits to your need.

To help you understand wether or not you API requests are failing or successful, we've used a UI tool to build in the ability to visualize notifications in the app. The specific style we use is referred to as a "toast" notification. To take advantage of this capability to visualize successful and failed API requests, an additional line of code will need to be added to [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) requests, examples of which can be found below.

- Success: `toast.success("Success!");`
- Failure: `toast.error("Failed!");`
